The code has been tested to work on Ubuntu 14.04 using Matlab R2012a. Please follow the below steps to use this code. 
1) run setup.sh This will install the [Darwin](https://github.com/sgould/drwn) library and the [Piotr's Computer Vision Matlab Toolbox](https://github.com/pdollar/toolbox). Note that the [Graz dataset](http://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/~rhayko/paper/cvpr2012_riemenschneider_lattice/) is also downloaded.
2) run src/run.sh This will use the auto-context framework to train and test on the Graz dataset. 

* Upon running the code successfully, you should get around on the Graz dataset.
* The training may take several hours. If you have more multiple-cores on your machine consider changing the "drwnThreadPool" attribute. Currently it is set to 8.
